# üöÄ React Todo List with User Authentication

This is a React application that provides a **Todo List** with basic **user authentication**. The project demonstrates how to manage user authentication using React's context and local state, and allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark todo items as complete/incomplete.

## üåü Features

### 1. **User Authentication**
- **Sign Up**: Users can register with an email, password, and name.
- **Login**: Users can log in using their registered email and password.
- **Authentication State Management**: Managed with React Context.
- **Form Validation**: Basic validation using **Formik** and **Yup**.
- **Error Feedback**: Users are notified of success/failure during login/registration.

### 2. **Todo List**
- **Add Todo**: Users can create new todo items by providing a title and description.
- **Edit Todo**: Modify existing todo items.
- **Delete Todo**: Remove items from the todo list.
- **Toggle Completion**: Mark todos as completed or incomplete.
- **Data Persistence**: Todos persist across page reloads using browser local storage.

### 3. **Additional Features**
- **Client-Side Routing**: **React Router** is used to separate authentication and todo pages.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is optimized for both desktop and mobile.
- **Clean UI**: Modern, clean design with user-friendly forms and validation feedback.
